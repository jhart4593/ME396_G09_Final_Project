# ME396_G09_Final_Project
We demonstrate the use of a decision tree ML algorithm in predicting large datasets using the XGBoost library

ML_test uses metrology data (nanosheet_18k.csv) to predict critical dimensions of a measured part

CA_Housing_Prediction uses the SKLearn California Housing Dataset to predict median house values for California districts
